# whiteboard
Whiteboard app using WebSockets.

I'm currently rewriting this app using a Rust (Tokio/Tungstenite-based) server and a Rust/WASM (Yew-based) frontend. The original (probably broken) Ruby server + HTML/JS client can be found on the [`master`](https://github.com/InputUsername/whiteboard/tree/master) branch.
